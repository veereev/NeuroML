			<p>
			Computational models based on detailed neuroanatomical and electrophysiological data have been used for many years as an aid for understanding the function of the nervous system. NeuroML is an international, collaborative initiative to develop a language for describing detailed models of neural systems.
</p>
			The aims of the NeuroML initiative are:
		<ul>
			<li>
				To create specifications for an XML-based language that describes the biophysics, anatomy and network architecture of neuronal systems at multiple scales,</li>
		</ul>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				To facilitate the exchange of complex neuronal models between researchers, allowing for greater transparency and accessibility of models,</li>
		</ul>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				To promote software tools which support NeuroML and support the development of new software and databases for neural modeling, and</li>
		</ul>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				To encourage researchers with models within the scope of NeuroML to exchange and publish their models in this format.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<br />
			<br />
			NeuroML is a free and open community effort that needs your support as the language and tools continue to evolve. Register here to be added to the NeuroML mailing list.</p>

Developments towards NeuroML version 2.0 are well under way, but version 1.8.x should be considered the stable version for now, especially for application/model developers who want maximum compatibility with other tools.
<br /><br />
For details of the meetings which have taken place to date where NeuroML v2.0 has been discussed see here.
