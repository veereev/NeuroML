NeuroML Development Workshops

    March 12-16, 2012: The fourth annual NeuroML Development Workshop took place at the Informatics Forum in Edinburgh, UK. The NeuroML workshop was combined with the BrainScaleS (previously FACETS) CodeJam meeting. More details can be found here.

    March 31st & April 1st, 2011: The third annual NeuroML Development Workshop took place in London. Minutes for this meeting can be found here. A key outcome of the meeting was the creation of a Scientific Committee for NeuroML.

    March 4-5, 2010: The second NeuroML Development Workshop was held in Arizona State University to plan for version 2.0 of the NeuroML model description language. More details about the workshop are available here. For the meeting minutes, see the 2010 workshop report. There was also a Symposium on Multiscale Approaches to Understanding Neural Plasticity held at ASU before the main meeting and a number of tutorials on software for multiscale modeling given by the meeting participants on the following day.

    March 9-10, 2009: The NeuroML Development Workshop was held at University College London. The focus of the workshop was to refine the specifications for describing models of channel kinetics and the biophysical properties of cells. Special thanks to the Wellcome Trust, the INCF, and the NSF for their generous support of this endeavour. More details are available here.
