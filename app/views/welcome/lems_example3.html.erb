<h1>Example 3: Connection dependent synaptic components</h1>


<p>
    In many models, a synapse is only created where a connection exists. This means that the model of the receiving 
    cell should only declare that particular types of synapse can be added to it, not the actual synapse sub-components
    themselves.
</p>


<p>
Not much is needed beyond the elements described in example 1 except for some extensions to 
the component that declares the connectivity and a new child element in the component that 
the synapses are attached to. The full example is shown below. The synapse type includes an 
<span class="xelt">EventPort</span> just like the previously defined cell type. The cell type however includes a new child element: 
<span class="xelt">Attachments</span> defined as:
<div class="xcode">
  
<div class="xcodeelement">&lt;<span class="xmlverb-element-name">Attachments</span> <span class="xmlverb-attr-name">name</span>="<span class="xmlverb-attr-content">synapses</span>" <span class="xmlverb-attr-name">type</span>="<span class="xmlverb-attr-content">synapse</span>" /&gt;</div>

</div>

This operates rather like the <span class="xelt">Children</span> element except that when a component is defined using this type the
sub-elements are not included in the component definition. Instead it indicates that instances of components of the 
particular type may be attached later when the model is actually run.
</p>
  
 

<p>
    TODO - replacement of the hard-coded Receiver element with something generic that is 
    accessible from a component type definition.
