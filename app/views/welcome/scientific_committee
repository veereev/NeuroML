<h1>NeuroML Scientific Committee</h1>


<p>We are indebted to the many <a href ="contributors.php">contributors</a> to NeuroML over the years.</p>

<p>At the <a href="workshop2011.php">2011 NeuroML Development Workshop</a> in London, the decision was made to create a Scientific Committee
    for NeuroML. Nominations were requested for members of this committee and the following were nominated and agreed to be part of the committee:</p>

The responsibilities of the Scientific Committee have been agreed to be:

<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
    <li>To advise on the scientific focus of the NeuroML initiative; to ensure 
that the structure of the language is based on the latest knowledge of 
neuronal anatomy and physiology</li>

<br/>
    <li>To agree on the technical implementation for the core specifications 
and to ensure that best practices are encouraged in model specification
</li>

<br/>
    <li>To promote NeuroML internationally, both the core specifications and 
the tools which support the language

</li>

<br/>
    <li>To define the governance structure of the NeuroML Initiative and 
outline a path towards a specification process with dedicated, elected 
editors

</li>
<br/>

    <li>To engage with other standardisation and databasing initiatives in the computational neuroscience and wider biology fields</li>
<br/>

    <li>To review and agree on extensions to the core specifications and the 
scope of the initiative; to address issues the community raises 
regarding the direction of the initiative</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<p>The best way to get in contact with members of the NeuroML initiative is through the 
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=neuroml-technology">neuroml-technology</a>
       mailing list.</p>
