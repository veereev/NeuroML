The changes in version 1.5 over version 1.4: 

General: 
- Introduced Release notes link for versions in ValidationResults.jsp with changes since last

MorphML:  
- Updated mapping from MorphML to NEURON, now uses same function calls as Cell Builder, e.g. topol()

Biophysics: 
Some extra unit definitions added, e.g. CurrentValue

ChannelML:
- Allowed different Q10 rate adjustments for different gates, as in GateDepQ10.xml, and supported this in the
NEURON/GENESIS mappings

- Added specification of basic I&F mechanism, see IntFireMechanism.xml. Based on the COBA based I and F model 
as used in Brette et al (2006) http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio.NC/0611089. The NEURON mapping is based on the script 
files from http://senselab.med.yale.edu/SenseLab/ModelDB/ShowModel.asp?model=83319. Note: there is no GENESIS 
mapping for this mechanism, as none was created for the paper

NetworkML:
- In SynapticLocation, some defaults added. 

- Added an optional attribute node_id in instance element in population. This allows specification of the 
computational node on which the cell instance should run. This can be calculated by various means when 
generating the network and stored along with the 3D structure. No description is yet included in the 
template specification for the rules for how the cells might be distributed.

- Electrical inputs to the network can be specified. 2 types are possible, current pulse based and random stimulation.
these should be further developed to allow easier specification of input protocols, a series of pulses, time dependent 
input rate, etc.
