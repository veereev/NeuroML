The changes in version 1.7 over version 1.6 (Dec 2007): 

Note: these changes go hand in hand with updates of the NEURON mappings to NeuroML at:
http://neuroml.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/neuroml/


General: 
- Added a link to a Version 2.0 Requirements page, where ideas for updates/refinements can be added. Any suggestions for
  additions are welcome via the mailing list: neuroml-technology@lists.sourceforge.net

- Updated HTML view of cell morphology to detail cables/num of segs in them/cable groups

- Minor updates to layout of HTML view of XSD files


Metadata:
- Added type Percentage (0-100 inclusive)


MorphML:  
- Added initial impl of X3D view of MorphML files, only lines for neurites so far. See X3D Support link...

- Added example of morphology (NeuroML Level 2) exported from NEURON (PyramidalCell.xml)


Biophysics:
- Added optional parameter passiveConductance to bio:mechanism element, meaning that when params gmax and e are included, 
  this mechanism is fully specified independent of a specific mechanism implementation.


ChannelML:
- Added ion role PermeatedSubstanceFixedRevPot for, e.g. ca chans with fixed ca rev pot (there are models out there 
  with this)

- Added optional ceiling param to Ca/DecayingPoolModel, to specify a max value the ion concentration can reach. 
  Impls for NEURON & GENESIS updated

- Added support for CaPool with fixed value for dependence on calcium current into compartment (in DecayingPoolModel). 
  Needed for Traub et al 2003


NetworkML:
- Added optional size attribute to instances element in NetworkML. This is redundant information, 
  but can be useful when the file is being parsed to allocate memory for an array of cells. NOTE: 
  will very likely become REQUIRED in v2.0

- Added initial impl of X3D views of NetworkML files. Note: only "pure" NetworkML file supported, 
  so single compartments for cell instances, segment_id ignored! See X3D Support link...
